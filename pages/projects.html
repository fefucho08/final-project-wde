                            Pastrote is a web application designed to streamline
                            the sale of past√©is during a Festa Junina
                            fundraising event for Trote da Cidadania, a
                            volunteer organization. The system manages payments,
                            tracks pastel inventory, and organizes the
                            production queue for fryers, ensuring a smooth and
                            efficient workflow. Built with React.js, the
                            frontend provides a user-friendly interface for
                            sellers and kitchen staff. I was responsible for
                            developing the frontend, focusing on usability and
                            performance to enhance the overall experience.

                            This platform allows users to play Minefield,

                            management and match tracking. The frontend is built
                            with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend,
                            developed in PHP, handles the SQL database for

                            This project focuses on applying essential concepts
                            of distributed systems and network communication by
                            developing a Java application with server and client
                            modules using the TCP/IP protocol. It reinforces
                            multithreading to handle multiple clients
                            simultaneously and includes a graphical user
                            interface (GUI) built with Swing. The system enables
                            a distributed voting platform where clients and a
                            central server interact securely to manage
                            elections, ensuring data integrity and preventing
                            duplication. The server handles vote collection,
                            validation (including CPF verification), and
                            real-time result display, while clients connect,
                            receive voting data, submit votes, and disconnect
                            after participation.

                            multithreading, and component customization. It
                            includes event listeners for user interactions, file
                            reading with content display, and a dynamically
                            animated background utilizing threads. Users can
