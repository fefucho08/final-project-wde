                <p>
                    I'm someone with many passions, and
                    <span class="important">technology</span> has always been
                    one of the strongest among them. My journey into programming
                    began when I was 14, during the pandemic, when my curiosity
                    led me to explore the world of code on my own. What started
                    as simple research quickly turned into a deep interest, and
                    from that point on, I've been constantly learning and
                    expanding my knowledge in the field. This passion and
                    dedication eventually led me to be admitted into the
                    <span class="important"
                        >second-best university in Latin America and the top
                        tech institution in Brazil</span
                    >
                    , the State University of Campinas, where I continue to
                    refine my skills and grow as a professional.
                </p>
                <div class="imageContainer">
                    <img
                        src="../assets/images/volunteer2.jpg"
                        alt="Image of me and a kid in a wheel chair"
                    />

                <p>
                    My love for technology extends beyond just programming. One
                    of my biggest interests is video gamesâ€”not only playing them
                    but also understanding how they are built. This curiosity
                    naturally led me to explore
                    <span class="important">game development</span>, a field
                    that perfectly combines logic, creativity, and
                    problem-solving. I find it fascinating how games can create
                    immersive experiences that engage players on multiple
                    levels, and I aspire to contribute to that world in my own
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my interests in technology and games, I also have a
                    strong passion for
                    <span class="important">volunteer work</span>, something
                    I've been involved in since I was 11 years old. I believe in
                    the power of giving back to the community and making a
                    positive impact on people's lives. My most recent experience
                    in this area was working with
                    <span class="important">Trote da Cidadania</span>, a
                    student-led organization at my university focused on social
                    initiatives. Being part of this project reinforced my
                    commitment to using my skills and time to contribute to
                    meaningful causes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another major passion of mine is tabletop RPGs. I love how
                    they bring people together, allowing for incredible
                    storytelling, strategic thinking, and boundless creativity.
                    Whether I'm playing or running a game, I enjoy the process
                    of crafting unique narratives and
                    <span class="important"
                        >solving challenges collaboratively.</span
                    >
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always eager to learn, experiment, and create. Whether
                    it's developing software, designing a game, or diving into a
                    new project, I thrive on challenges and the opportunity to
                    bring ideas to life. I believe that technology, combined
                    with creativity and social responsibility, has the power to
                    build amazing things, and I'm excited to be part of that
                    journey.
