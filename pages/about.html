                <p>
                    I'm someone with many passions, and
                    <strong class="important">technology</strong> has always
                    been one of the strongest among them. My journey into
                    programming began when I was 14, during the pandemic, when
                    my curiosity led me to explore the world of code on my own.
                    What started as simple research quickly turned into a deep
                    interest, and from that point on, I've been constantly
                    learning and expanding my knowledge in the field. This
                    passion and dedication eventually led me to be admitted into
                    the
                    <strong class="important"
                        >second-best university in Latin America and the top
                        tech institution in Brazil</strong
                    >
                    , the State University of Campinas, where I continue to
                    refine my skills and grow as a professional.

                    <img
                        src="../assets/images/volunteer2.webp"
                        alt="Image of me and a kid in a wheel chair"

                <p>
                    My love for technology extends beyond just programming. One
                    of my biggest interests is video gamesâ€”not only playing them
                    but also understanding how they are built. This curiosity
                    naturally led me to explore
                    <span class="important">game development</span>, a field
                    that perfectly combines logic, creativity, and
                    problem-solving. I find it fascinating how games can create
                    immersive experiences that engage players on multiple
                    levels, and I aspire to contribute to that world in my own
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my interests in technology and games, I also have a
                    strong passion for
                    <span class="important">volunteer work</span>, something
                    I've been involved in since I was 11 years old. I believe in
                    the power of giving back to the community and making a
                    positive impact on people's lives. My most recent experience
                    in this area was working with
                    <span class="important">Trote da Cidadania</span>, a
                    student-led organization at my university focused on social
                    initiatives. Being part of this project reinforced my
                    commitment to using my skills and time to contribute to
                    meaningful causes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another major passion of mine is tabletop RPGs. I love how
                    they bring people together, allowing for incredible
                    storytelling, strategic thinking, and boundless creativity.
                    Whether I'm playing or running a game, I enjoy the process
                    of crafting unique narratives and
                    <span class="important"
                        >solving challenges collaboratively.</span
                    >
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always eager to learn, experiment, and create. Whether
                    it's developing software, designing a game, or diving into a
                    new project, I thrive on challenges and the opportunity to
                    bring ideas to life. I believe that technology, combined
                    with creativity and social responsibility, has the power to
                    build amazing things, and I'm excited to be part of that
                    journey.

                        I currently specialize in front-end development, which
                        aligns well with my studies at
                        <span class="important">Tamwood</span>. This area has
                        been my primary focus, allowing me to refine my skills
                        in crafting visually engaging and user-friendly
                        interfaces. However, I also have substantial knowledge
                        and experience in back-end development.

                        <span class="important">UNICAMP</span>. This solid
                        foundation in back-end technologies enables me to
                        approach projects with a well-rounded perspective and
                        contribute effectively to both ends of the development
                        process.

                        My academic experience has played a crucial role in
                        shaping my professional development. Studying at
                        UNICAMP, recognized as one of the top universities in
                        Latin America and the
                        <span class="important">
                            leading institution for technology in Brazil</span
                        >, has provided me with a broad and comprehensive
                        foundation across various fields of knowledge. The
                        rigorous and innovative academic environment at UNICAMP
                        has instilled in me a
                        <span class="important"
                            >strong analytical mindset, adaptability, and

                        that are essential for tackling diverse challenges in
                        the professional world.

                        Additionally, my international experience at Tamwood has
                        been invaluable. It has not only contributed
                        significantly to my personal growth by exposing me to
                        different cultures and perspectives but also allowed me
                        to focus on acquiring
